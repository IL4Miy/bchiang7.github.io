      I'm currently studying Computer Science at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/" target="_blank">RWTH Aachen University</a>.
      I work as an independent software developer since 2015 and realised some awesome projects.
      In addition I had two internships at german software studios.

      As a software developer, I love building amazing applications from the initial design to the finished product.
      I like exploring new technologies and practices.
      My goal is to build scalable, robust and extensible applications that look beautiful and feel easy to use.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably skiing, playing handball ü§æüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, meeting friends
      or traveling.
